# Contributing guidelines

This document describes how to contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

- [go](https://golang.org/dl/) version v1.18+.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version 17.03+.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) version v1.11.3+.
- [kustomize](https://sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/docs/INSTALL.md) v4+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.21+ cluster (the easiest way to develop is using [Kind][kind]).

## Contributing steps

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
3. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

## How to build RaptorML locally

Note that, by building RaptorML from the source code we are allowed to test the changes made locally.

1. Run the following command to clone your fork of the project locally

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:<user>/raptor.git
    ```
2. Build the project locally

    ```
    make build
    ```
   It's also possible to build the docker images locally using the following command:
    ```
    make docker-build
    ```

## Set up a local development cluster

To develop RaptorML locally, you can use [Tilt][tilt], with the pre-configured setup to build a local setup.

1. Install [Tilt][tilt]
2. Create a local development cluster. We're highly recommending using [Kind][kind] and [ctlptl][ctlptl] to create a
   local cluster.

   Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container ‚Äúnodes‚Äù. ctlptl is a tool for managing
   local Kubernetes clusters.
   `ctlptl` is a tool for managing local Kubernetes clusters. It can create a local cluster using `kind` and configure
   it to be ready for development.

    ```console
    ctlptl create cluster kind --registry=ctlptl-registry --name kind-raptor
    ```
   This command will create a local Kind cluster, with a local registry ready to be used.
3. Start the Tilt environment

    ```console
    tilt up
    ```
   This command will start the Tilt environment, which will build the docker images and deploy the RaptorML components
   to the local cluster.

The Tilt environment will watch for changes in the source code and will automatically rebuild the images and redeploy
the components.

In addition, it'll create the necessary resources to run RaptorML locally, including Redis, Ingress controller(ngnix),
and Prometheus - and will automatically create port-forwarding to the local cluster.

While developing Raptor, the Tilt environment will watch for changes in the source code and will automatically rebuild
the images and redeploy the components.

We're also attaching to this environment a go debugger, which will allow us to debug the code while running it locally.

**You can connect to the debugger on port `2345` for the `raptor-controller-core`,
and `2346` for the `raptor-historian`.**

## What to do before submitting a pull request

1. Run the script `make generate` to update/generate autogenerated files.
2. Run `make test`
3. Run `make test-e2e`

- e2e tests use [`kind`][kind] and [`kustomize`][kustomize]. Make sure that you have the latest versions of these tools
  installed on your machine.

**IMPORTANT:** The `make generate` is very helpful. By using it, you can check if good part of the commands still
working successfully after the changes. Also, note that its usage is a pre-requirement to submit a PR.

Following the targets that can be used to test your changes locally.

| `make docker-build` | Build docker images                                     | yes                  |
| `make kind-load`    | Load docker images to local Kind cluster                | no                   |

## PR Process

Individual commits should not be tagged separately, but will generally be assumed to match the PR. For instance, if you
have a bugfix in with a breaking change, it's generally encouraged to submit the bugfix separately, but if you must put
them in one PR, mark the commit separately.

### Commit Message Format

We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to standardize our commit messages.
This allows us to automatically generate changelogs and release notes, to create a more readable git history and to
automatically trigger semantic versioning. This way no human is directly involved in the release process and the
releases are guaranteed to
be [unromantic and unsentimental](http://sentimentalversioning.org/).

Please make sure to follow the following format when writing commit messages and PR titles:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ [optional] Commit Scope, i.e.: LabSDK, pyexp, cli, engine, ...
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

We support the following [Conventional Commit Types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types):

| Type       | Title                    | Description                                                                                                             |

| `revert`   | Reverts                  | Reverts a previous commit. Commit body should contain the reason and the SHA of the reverted commit                     |

Examples:

```
fix: Correct typo.
feat: Add support for COUNT aggregation .
refactor!: Change the get feature API.
feat(labsdk): Add new way to export features
```

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes, are changes that break the public API of the project. They are marked with a `!` after the type/scope,
e.g.: `refactor!: change the python API`. This will trigger a `MAJOR` version bump when the commit is merged.

Breaking changes should be avoided if possible, but if they are necessary, they should be properly communicated to the
users and developers of the project.

üí° Note that since PR titles only have a single line, you have to use the `!` syntax for breaking changes.

## Contributing major changes

Contributing major changes such as new features or refactoring are always welcome! That being said, they require an
extra care for us to be able to review them before merging them. To do this, we need you to:

1. Explain in details the proposed change, including the motivation, the proposed solution, and the architecture(when
   applicable).
2. Provide at least one example of how to use the proposed change (when applicable; i.e new feature).
3. Write a test for the proposed change (e2e / unit test).

## Where the CI Tests are configured

See the [action files](.github/workflows) to check its tests, and the scripts used on it.

## Profiling

If you find yourself in a need to profile the app, it's possible by adding the following lines to the `main.go`:

```go
mgr.AddMetricsExtraHandler("/debug/pprof/", http.HandlerFunc(pprof.Index))
mgr.AddMetricsExtraHandler("/debug/pprof/cmdline", http.HandlerFunc(pprof.Cmdline))
mgr.AddMetricsExtraHandler("/debug/pprof/profile", http.HandlerFunc(pprof.Profile))
mgr.AddMetricsExtraHandler("/debug/pprof/symbol", http.HandlerFunc(pprof.Symbol))
mgr.AddMetricsExtraHandler("/debug/pprof/trace", http.HandlerFunc(pprof.Trace))
```
