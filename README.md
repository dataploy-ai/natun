## üßê What is Raptor?

Raptor enables data scientists and ML engineers to build and deploy operational models and ML-driven functionality,
**without learning backend engineering**.

With Raptor, you can export your Python research code as standard production artifacts, and deploy them to Kubernetes.
Once you deployed, Raptor optimize data processing and feature calculation for production, deploy models
to Sagemaker or Docker containers, connect to your production data sources, scaling, high availability, caching,
monitoring, and all other backend concerns.

[![Colab][colab-button]][colab-url]

### üòç Why people *love* Raptor? and how does it change their lives?

Before Raptor, data scientists had to work closely with software engineers to translate their models into
production-ready code, connect to data sources, transform their data with Flink/Spark or even Java, create APIs,
dockerizing the model, handle scaling and high availability, and more.

With Raptor, data scientists can focus *only* on their research and model development, then export their work to
production. Raptor takes care of the rest, including connecting to data sources, transforming the data, deploying and
connecting the model, etc. This means data scientists can focus on what they do best, and Raptor handles the rest.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features

* **Easy to use**: Raptor is user-friendly and can be started within 5 minutes.
* **Eliminate serving/training skew**: You can use the same code for training and production to avoid training serving
  skew.
* **Real-time/on-demand**: Raptor optimizes feature calculations and predictions to be performed at the time of request.
* **Seamless Caching and storage**: Raptor uses an integrated caching system, and store your historical data for
  training purposes. So you won't need any other data storage system such as "Feature Store".
* **Turns data science work into production artifacts**: Raptor implements best-practice functionalities of Kubernetes
  solutions, such as scaling, health, auto-recovery, monitoring, logging, and more.
* **Integrates with R&D team**: Raptor extends existing DevOps tools and infrastructure and allows you to connect your
  ML
  research to the rest of your organization's R&D ecosystem, utilizing tools such as CI/CD and monitoring.

## üí° How does it work?

The work with Raptor starts in your research phase in your notebook or IDE. Raptor allows you to write your ML work in a
translatable way for production purposes.

Models and Features in Raptor are composed of a declarative part(via Python's decorators) and a function code. This
way, Raptor can translate the heavy-lifting engineering concerns(such as aggregations or caching) by implementing the
"declarative part", and optimize the implementation for production.

![Features are composed from a declarative part and a function code][feature-py-def]

After you are satisfied with your research results, "export" these definitions, and deploy it to Kubernetes using
standard tools; Once deployed, Raptor Core(the server-side part) is extending Kubernetes with the ability to implement
them. It takes care of the engineering concerns by managing and controlling Kubernetes-native resources such as
deployments to connect your production data sources and run your business logic at scale.

You can read more about Raptor's architecture in [the docs][docs-url].

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Raptor's LabSDK is the quickest and most popular way to develop RaptorML compatible features.

[![Colab][colab-button]][colab-url]

The LabSDK allows you to write Raptor-compatible features using Python and "convert" them to Kubernetes resources.
This way, in most of the use-cases, you can iterate and play with your data.

### Production Installation

**Raptor installation is not required for training purposes**.
You only need to install Raptor *when deploying to production* (or staging).

Learn more about production installation at [the docs][docs-url].

#### Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes cluster

   (You can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to install Raptor locally)
2. `kubectl` installed and configured to your cluster.
3. Redis server (> 2.8.9)

### Installation

The easiest way to install Raptor is to use
the [OperatorHub Installation method](https://operatorhub.io/operator/raptor).

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## üåç "Hello World" feature

```python
@feature(keys='name')
@freshness(target='-1', invalid_after='-1')
def emails_deals(_, ctx: Context) -> float:
    return f"hello world {ctx.keys['name']}!"
```

## üêç Full example

```python
import pandas as pd
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from labsdk.raptor import *


@data_source(
    training_data=pd.read_csv(
        'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AlmogBaku/8be77c2236836177b8e54fa8217411f2/raw/hello_world_transactions.csv'),
    keys=['customer_id'],
    production_config=StreamingConfig()
)
class BankTransaction(TypedDict):
    customer_id: int
    amount: float
    timestamp: str


# Define features
@feature(keys='customer_id', data_source=BankTransaction)
@aggregation(function=AggregationFunction.Sum, over='10h', granularity='1h')
def total_spend(this_row: BankTransaction, ctx: Context) -> float:
    """total spend by a customer in the last hour"""
    return this_row['amount']


@feature(keys='customer_id', data_source=BankTransaction)
@freshness(max_age='5h', max_stale='1d')
def amount(this_row: BankTransaction, ctx: Context) -> float:
    """total spend by a customer in the last hour"""
    return this_row['amount']


# Train the model
@model(
    keys=['customer_id'],
    input_features=['total_spend+sum'],
    input_labels=[amount],
    model_framework='sklearn',
    model_server='sagemaker-ack',
)
@freshness(max_age='1h', max_stale='100h')
def amount_prediction(ctx: TrainingContext):
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    df = ctx.features_and_labels()

    trainer = LinearRegression()
    trainer.fit(df[ctx.input_features], df[ctx.input_labels])

    return trainer


amount_prediction.export()
```

Then, we can deploy the generated resources to Kubernetes using `kubectl` or instructing the DevOps team to integrate
the generated `Makefile` into the existing CI/CD pipeline.
