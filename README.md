## üßê What is Raptor?

With Raptor, Data Scientists can write ML Features that can work in production directly in your notebook and deploy
them to production on their own (yes! without going through the engineering team). **It's like writing Lambda for
Feature Engineering.**

After developing your ML features, deploy them to your Kubernetes, and the Raptor extension will take care of the
production concerns (such as scale, high availability, authentication, caching, monitoring, etc.)

[![Colab][colab-button]][colab-url]

### üòç Why people *love* Raptor?

* **Data Scientists** love Raptor because it's easy to use and make a use of their work.
  No more excuses from the engineering team!
* **DevOps teams** love Raptor because it's **built on top of Kubernetes**, leveraging their standard stack, and it's
  *ridiculously* easy to deploy and manage (because of Kubernetes, duh?).

And what about the engineers? Well, it's finally taking away this "burden"  from them.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

* **Same code for both training and production**<br/>
  You can run the same Raptor compatible features in training and production and prevent the *training serving skew*.
* **Real-Time / On-demand feature calculation**<br/>
  Raptor is optimizing features to be calculated at the time of the request.
* **Caching and storing**<br/>
  Raptor is utilizing an integrated Feature-Store to cache the calculation results and take snapshots of the data
  to cold storage for historical purposes (such as re-training).
* **Pluggable**<br/>
  Raptor is highly-pluggable. Technically, you can even bring your own feature store implementation.
* **Kubernetes Native and Standards**<br/>
  Raptor is implementing by-design functionalities of Kubernetes such as leader-election, scaling, health,
  auto-recovery,
  monitoring and logging.

## üí° How does it work?

Raptor introduces a new way to describe feature transformations by describing them as functions composed of declarative(
via Python's decorators) and imperative(function code) parts. This way, we can instruct the "Natun Core" to implement
the "declarative part" and optimize your production code.

Behind the scene, Raptor Core is extending Kubernetes with the ability to process your features in a "production manner"
. It takes care of the engineering concerns by managing and controlling Kubernetes-native resources such as deployments
to connect your production data sources and run your business logic at scale. Allowing you to **focus on the business
logic**.

You can read more about Raptor's architecture in [the docs][docs-url].

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

The LabSDK is the quickest and most popular way to develop RaptorML compatible features.

[![Colab][colab-button]][colab-url]

The LabSDK allows you to write Raptor-compatible features using Python and "convert" them to Kubernetes resources.
This way, in most of the use-cases, you can iterate and play with your data.

### Production Installation

**Raptor installation is not required for training purposes**.
You only need to install Raptor *when deploying to production* (or staging).

Learn more about production installation at [the docs][docs-url].

#### Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes cluster

   (You can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to install Raptor locally)
2. `kubectl` installed and configured to your cluster.
3. Redis server

   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Tip: You can also use a managed Redis solution such as [AWS ElasticCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
   or [GCP Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), or via
   the [K8s Redis Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/redis-operator)*

### Installation

The easiest way to install Raptor is to use
the [OperatorHub Installation method](https://operatorhub.io/operator/raptor).

## üåç "Hello World" feature

We know, you played with [the quick starter][colab-url] already.. But let's paste here some "hello world" code
for the lazy bastard out there üëπ

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation][docs-url]_

### Option 1: Using LabSDK

```python
@raptor.register(str, freshness="1m", staleness="15m")
def hello_world(**req: RaptorRequest):
    return "hello " + req["entity_id"] + "!"
```

### Option 2: RaptorML compatible Feature (the Kubernetes native way)

The code below, is actually the results of Option 1 above ü§™
But in case you've decided to not use the LabSDK, you can write a Feature Definition like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.raptor.ml/v1alpha1
    kind: Feature
    metadata:
        name: hello_world
    spec:
        primitive: string
        freshness: 1m
        staleness: 15m
        builder:
            kind: expression
    pyexp: |
        def hello_world(**req):
            return 'hello ' + req['entity_id']) + '!'
```
